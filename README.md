## üìñ About The Project

Web accessibility (a11y) is crucial for creating inclusive web experiences, but identifying and fixing issues can be complex and time-consuming. **A11y AI Inspector** is a browser extension designed to help developers, testers, and designers automatically scan web pages for accessibility violations.

Unlike traditional rule-based checkers, this tool leverages AI and machine learning to provide intelligent, context-aware suggestions for fixes, such as generating descriptive alt-text for images.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Rule-based Scanning:** Detects common WCAG violations like missing `alt` attributes, incorrect heading structures, and missing `aria-labels`.
* **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Uses a backend ML model to suggest meaningful `alt` text for images and recommend color contrast improvements.
* **Accessibility Score:** Provides a quantifiable score (out of 100) to quickly assess a page's overall accessibility health.
* **One-Click Auto-Fixes (In-DOM):** Apply suggested fixes directly in the browser to preview changes instantly.
* **Highlight Issues on Page:** Visually pinpoints the exact elements on the page that have accessibility issues.
* **Exportable Reports:** Generate detailed accessibility audit reports in PDF or CSV format for documentation and team collaboration.
